# Postdoc planning

A collection of resources that will hopefully be useful for planning a postdoc
in the US.

This metaresource is mostly geared towards the computational biology people,
but possibly others will find it helpful.

# PLEASE HELP

I'm hoping this can be a community effort since we all have some incomplete
information. I'm also happy to take suggestions via Twitter:
